# Pixeldrain URL Bypasser

An easy-to-use website that fetches download URLs directly with metadata, and also avoids Pixeldrain limitations on file and folder URLs.  Developed with HTML, PHP, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and deployed on Railway.


## Features

- Can handle multiple URLs of file or folder pixeldrain per request.
- Also can handle file and folder pixeldrain simultaneously.
- Handles URLs pointing to files within ZIP archives, allowing individual files inside the ZIP to be downloaded directly.
- Fetch metadata of Pixeldrain URLs
- Simple UI and easy-to-use


## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** HTML, TailwindCSS

**Backend:** JavaScript (Vanilla), PHP

**Deployment:** Railway


## Run Locally

1. Go to the root directory

```bash
# If you use Laragon
cd C:\laragon\www

# if you use xampp
cd C:\xampp\htdocs
```

2. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennycw19/pixeldrain-bypass.git
```
3. Don't forget to update the fetch URL in the JavaScript code from the deployed endpoint:
```
https://pixeldrain-bypass.up.railway.app/php/bypass.php
```
to the local path:
```
http://localhost/pixeldrain-bypass/php/bypass.php
```
This ensures the backend requests are correctly routed to your local server instead of the deployed version.
4. Start Laragon

5. Open your browser at http://localhost/pixeldrain-bypass/


## Deployment

To deploy this website on Railway, PHP must run within a Docker container. The following is the Dockerfile used for this setup:

```
# This Dockerfile sets up a PHP environment with Apache for the Pixeldrain Bypass application

# Use PHP 8.2 with Apache
FROM php:8.2-apache

# Copy all files to the container
COPY . /var/www/html/

# Activate mod_rewrite if needed
RUN a2enmod rewrite

# Set working directory in a container
